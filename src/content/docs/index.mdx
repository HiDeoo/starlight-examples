## How to use

Each of these examples demonstrates how to do a specific thing in a Starlight documentation site.
Most pages include a short description of the technique being demonstrated, but these are not fully formed guides or tutorials.

Each example features a StackBlitz embed of a complete Starlight project implementing the technique in question.
The embeds contain a live code editor and a preview pane.
Embeds work best on larger screens, but will load on mobile too if needed.

You can use the embeds to:

- See a preview of the technique
- Click around the different files to see how they implement things
- Edit the code and see changes reflected in the preview pane

Many of the examples included here demonstrate a concept, but may need modifying for your specific use case.
Feel free to copy and edit code as you need to.
